:elephant: Mission
==================

This app attempts to help us make better food choices by putting the nutrition data from the [USDA National Nutrient Database](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/) in an easily digestible form. By comparing foods in terms of nutrients per calorie, we're able to get an idea of what's healthy and what's empty.


:octopus: Play with the code
============================

To tinker with the uncompiled code, you'll need [Node](http://nodejs.org), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
  
    npm install
    npm start
